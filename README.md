# Lap-pkg-for-YOLO
Simply put the two inner folders into your enviroment site packages folder. Should be under "lib"
Got sick of trying to find this package so I made it public. Not sure entirely what it does but I know it invovles tracking and is needed for my YOLOv8 tracker. If you have error like requirements: YOLOv8 requirement "lap>=0.4" not found, or legacy install failure this is the solution.
